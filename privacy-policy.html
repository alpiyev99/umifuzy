  <div class="text-block-10">Trysintra recognizes the importance of your privacy. We&#x27;re dedicated to safeguarding the privacy of your personal information while using this website. This Privacy Policy outlines how we protect and utilize the information we collect from you. By using this website, you agree to the terms of the latest version of this Privacy Policy. Additionally, you should review our Terms of Use to understand the general rules governing your use of this website and any additional terms applicable when you access specific services or materials on certain areas of this website. “We,” “our” refers to Trysintra and its affiliates. “You,” “your,” “visitor,” or “user” denotes the individual accessing this site. Our Privacy Policy explains how we handle your personal and non-personal information.   WHAT IS NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION AND HOW IS IT COLLECTED AND USED?   Non-personal information is data that cannot identify you. If you visit this website to read information, like information about one of our services, we may gather certain non-personal information about you from your computer&#x27;s web browser. Since non-personal information can&#x27;t identify or be connected to you in any way, there are no limitations on how we can use or share non-personal information. What is personal information and how is it collected? Personal information is data that identifies you as an individual, such as your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, and fax number. We may collect personal information from you through various methods: • When you send us an application or other form • When you conduct a transaction with us, our affiliates, or others • When we collect information about you in support of a transaction, like credit card information • In specific areas of this website, you have the option to send us personal information about yourself, sign up to receive specific information, buy access to one of our products or services, or participate in an activity.   ARE COOKIES OR OTHER TECHNOLOGIES USED TO COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?   Yes, we may use cookies and related technologies like web beacons to collect information on our website. A cookie is a text file placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the main purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. Cookies enable a web server to remember that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you register with us, a cookie helps Trysintra to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, like billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Trysintra website, your prior-provided information can be retrieved, allowing you to easily use the features you customized. A web beacon is a small graphic image that allows the party that set the web beacon to monitor and collect certain information about the viewer of the web page, web-based document, or email message, such as the type of browser requesting the web beacon, the computer&#x27;s IP address to which the web beacon is sent, and the time the web beacon was viewed. Web beacons can be very small and invisible to the user, but in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or email, including HTML-based content, can serve as a web beacon. We may use web beacons to count visitors to the web pages on the website or to monitor how our users navigate the website, and we may include web beacons in email messages to count how many messages sent were opened, acted upon, or forwarded.   Third-party vendors may also use cookies on our website. For example, we may contract with third parties who use cookies on our website to track and analyze anonymous usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and members. This information is shared externally only on an anonymous, aggregated basis. These third parties use persistent cookies to help us improve the visitor experience, manage our site content, and track visitor behavior. We may also contract with a third party to send email to our registered users or members.   To help measure and improve the effectiveness of our email communications, third parties set cookies. All data collected by this third party on behalf of Trysintra is used solely by or on behalf of Trysintra and is shared externally only on an anonymous, aggregated basis. Occasionally, we may allow third parties to post advertisements on our website, and those third-party advertisements may include a cookie or web beacon served by the third party. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of information collected from you by third-party ad servers. We do not control cookies in such third-party ads, and you should check the privacy policies of those advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology before linking to an ad. We will not share your personal information with these companies, but they may use information about your visits to this and other websites to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. They may also share your personal information that you provide to them with others.   You have the option to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. Should you choose to decline cookies, you might not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Trysintra websites you visit.   HOW DOES Trysintra USE PERSONAL INFORMATION?   Trysintra may store and use personal information we collect from or about you to provide you with access to this website or other products or services, to respond to your requests, to bill you for products/services you purchased, and to offer ongoing service and support, to contact you with information that may be of interest to you, including information about products and services of ours and of others, or to ask for your opinion about our products or the products of others, for recordkeeping and analytical purposes, and to research, develop, and improve programs, products, services, and content.   Personal information collected online may be combined with information you provide to us through other sources. We may also remove your personal identifiers (your name, email address, social security number, etc.). In this case, you would no longer be identified as a single unique individual. Once we have de-identified information, it is non-personal information, and we may treat it like other non-personal information. Lastly, we might use your personal information to protect our rights or property, or to protect someone&#x27;s health, safety, or welfare, and to comply with a law or regulation, court order, or other legal processes.   DOES Trysintra SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH OTHERS?   We will not share your personal information collected from this website with an unrelated third party without your permission, except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy. In the normal course of business, we may share some personal information with companies that we hire to perform services or functions on our behalf. In all cases in which we share your personal information with a third party for the purpose of providing a service to us, we will not authorize them to keep, disclose, or use your information with others except for the purpose of providing the services we asked them to provide. We will not sell, exchange, or publish your personal information, except in conjunction with a corporate sale, merger, dissolution, or acquisition. For some types of transactions, in addition to our direct collection of information, our third-party service vendors (such as credit card companies, clearinghouses, and banks) may provide services such as credit, insurance, and escrow services and may collect personal information directly from you to assist you with your transaction. We do not control how these third parties use such information, but we do ask them to disclose how they use your personal information before they collect it. If you submit a review for a third party (person or business) using our Facebook Fan Review Application, during the submission process, we ask your permission to gather your basic information (such as name and email address) which we then share with the third party for whom you are submitting the review. We may be legally compelled to release your personal information in response to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, law, or regulation.   We may cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating and prosecuting website visitors who violate our rules or engage in behavior that is harmful to other visitors (or illegal). We may disclose your personal information to third parties if we feel that the disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or property, protect someone&#x27;s health, safety, or welfare, or to comply with a law or regulation, court order, or other legal processes. As discussed in the section on cookies and other technologies, we may occasionally allow a third party to serve advertisements on this website.   If you share information with the advertiser, including by clicking on their ads, this Privacy Policy does not control the advertiser’s use of your personal information, and you should check the privacy policies of those advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology before linking to an ad.   HOW IS PERSONAL INFORMATION USED FOR COMMUNICATIONS?   We may periodically contact you by email, mail, or phone to provide information regarding programs, products, services, and content that may be of interest to you. Additionally, some website features allow you to communicate with us using an online form. If your communication requests a response from us, we may send you a response via email. The email response or confirmation may include your personal information. We cannot guarantee the security of our emails to you from unauthorized interception.   HOW IS PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURED? We have put in place generally accepted standards of technology and operational security to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction. Only authorized personnel and third-party vendors have access to your personal information, and they are required to treat this information as confidential. Despite these precautions, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will not obtain access to your personal information.   LINKS  This site contains links to other sites that provide information we believe to be interesting. Trysintra is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these websites.   PUBLIC DISCUSSIONS This site may offer public discussions on various business valuation topics. Please be aware that any information you post in these discussions will become public, so avoid posting sensitive information in the public discussions.
