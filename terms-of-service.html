Before you file an infringement notice, please carefully consider whether or not the use of copyrighted material at issue is protected by the “fair use” doctrine, as you could be liable for costs and attorneys’ fees should you file a takedown notice where there is no infringing use. Please also check to make sure you haven’t authorized the use at issue (for example, whether you have given a creative professional who prepared materials for your company the right to use those materials as examples of his or her past work). If you are unsure whether a use of your copyrighted material constitutes infringement, please contact an attorney.

In all cases, if you do not hear from us within 14 days of submitting a complaint, please contact us and we will respond as soon as possible.

Upon receipt of a valid counter-notification, trysintra will forward it to the notifying party who submitted the original DMCA notification.

GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION All matters relating to the Services and these Terms of Use, and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction). Subject to Section 19, any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of, or related to, these Terms of Use or the Services shall be instituted exclusively in the Southern District of New York or the courts of the State of New York, in each case located in the County of New York, although we retain the right to bring any suit, action or proceeding against you for breach of these Terms of Use in your country of residence or any other relevant country. You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.19. DISPUTE RESOLUTION Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and trysintra in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and trysintra agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these Terms of Use, your use of the Site or the Services or the purchase, receipt, order or use any of any course will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. Exceptions. Despite the provisions of the Section entitled “Generally” directly above, nothing in these Terms of Use will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (b) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (c) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim. Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and trysintra will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms of Use, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement. Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by U.S. Mail or electronic mail (“Notice”). The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or trysintra may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or trysintra must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Use, trysintra will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in New York, New York. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse trysintra for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits. No Class Actions. YOU AND trysintra AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and trysintra agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. If trysintra makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to trysintra address for notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to trysintra address for notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and trysintra. Enforceability. If the Section entitled “No Class Actions” is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section will be null and void and, in that case, both you and trysintra agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described directly below will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms of Use or your use of or access of the Site, the Services or the purchase, receipt, order of a course.20. LIMITATION ON TIME TO FILE CLAIMS ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR THE SERVICE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES; OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.21. WAIVER AND SEVERABILITY No waiver of by trysintra of any term or condition set forth in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of trysintra to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.22. NO THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES AND ASSIGNMENT You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Terms of Use, there shall be no third-party beneficiaries to this agreement. You may not assign this Terms of Use without the prior written consent of trysintra, but trysintra may assign or transfer this Terms of Use, in whole or in part, without restriction.23. ENTIRE AGREEMENT The Terms of Use constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and trysintra with respect to the Services and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to the Services.24. LANGUAGE Any version of these Terms in a language other than English is provided for convenience and you understand and agree that the English language will control if there is any conflict.25.
